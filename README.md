### Production Server Installation **(WIP)**

**Database**

*New Phone Who Dis (NPWD)* uses its own database driver compatible with `mysql-async` and `ghmattimysql`'s connection string. If you
don't utilize these resources, ensure you have this set in your console.

```
set mysql_connection_string "server=127.0.0.1;database=es_extended;userid=user;password=pass"
```

### Configuration

This resource is highly configurable through the [config.json](./config.json). This JSON file holds configuration for the phone itself, for the apps running on it and peripheral information.

Below is the list of current configuration options **(WIP)**:

### Discord

To configure Discord integration; add the following variables to your `server.cfg` file:

```
set discord_bot_token "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"
set discord_channel_id "YOUR_DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID"
```

Current Discord integrations with the phone **(WIP)**:

- Twitter: reporting tweets

## Development

This resource is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) project with a TypeScript client/server environment.

### Prerequisites

The Installation Steps assumes you have the following prerequisites:

1. The ability to open a terminal. It's *recomended*, not required, to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or Windows Powershell for the sake of this guide to better provide support should issues arise. 
1. [Git for windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) installed
1. [LTS node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) installed
1. [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager installed (`npm install -g yarn`)
1. A fivem environment that is set up according to the [setting up a server instructions](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/server-manual/setting-up-a-server/) from the fivem documentation.

#### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repo into your `server-data/resources/` folder. The path will be `server-data\resources\new-phone-who-dis`. **Don't clone the repo into a sub folder.**
1. Ensure the resource folder is named `new-phone-who-dis`.
1. Import the [sql file](https://github.com/project-error/new-phone-who-dis/blob/master/resources/import.sql) into your database.
1. Add `ensure new-phone-who-dis` to your `server.cfg`.
1. Make your configurations in the [config.json](https://github.com/project-error/new-phone-who-dis/blob/master/config.json) **before** building the phone.
1. Open a terminal with the program of your choice.
1. Change your directiory into `new-phone-who-dis\phone` *like so*: `cd A:\FXServer\server-data\resources\new-phone-who-dis\phone`
1. Install node dependencies with `yarn install`.
1. Build in the current directory with `yarn build`.
1. Change your directiory into `new-phone-who-dis\resources` *like so*: `cd A:\FXServer\server-data\resources\new-phone-who-dis\resources`
1. Install node dependencies with`yarn install`.
1. Build in the current directory with `yarn build`.
1. Start your FiveM server

#### Development iteration cycle:
- You must rebuild the resource following any changes by doing `yarn build` in the `resources` and `phone` folder.
- If iteration on UI changes run the project with `yarn watch` which will monitor the JavaScript project and rebuild when you make code changes and then do `ensure new-phone-who-dis` after making your change.
- Avoid commiting `index.html` as the development version overrides the production version

#### React Devtools

When in development mode, the bundle includes a standalone React DevTools module, that allows access to react-devtools comparable to the browser environment.

First ensure you have react-devtools installed globally by running one of the following commands:

#### Yarn
```shell
yarn global add react-devtools
```

#### NPM
```shell
npm install -g react-devtools
```

Then run this command from your preffered terminal:
```shell
react-devtools
```
Now start your `ensure NPWD` with the development build, and you should have access to the React DevTools just as you would in the browser!

### Important Note

- By installing NPWD you agree to the use of the following diagnostic package, Sentry, (in use within the React portion of NPWD), that automatically
uploads relevant sesssion details and stack traces whenever an exception is thrown. We use these metrics to further
improve the quality of the phone. To explicitly disable this (we urge you not to as its incredibly useful metrics for us).
Please change the `SentryErrorMetrics` setting to `false` in `phone/config/default.json` and rebuild the phone.

- This resource has **NOT** been tested with [esx_kashacter](https://github.com/FiveEYZ/esx_kashacter) so compatability with it is unknown. For best results, use the resource on with no kash.
